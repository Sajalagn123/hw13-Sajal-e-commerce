## Description 
I added a few working routes such as get, which returns products in a JSON format when clicked on, as well as post. Product, category, or tag can be created or a user can search all products, categories, and tags or just search for a specific one by using its ID.

I added the other routes, which are put and delete. A specific product, category, or tag can now be updated or deleted by entering its ID.
