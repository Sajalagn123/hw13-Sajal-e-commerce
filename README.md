## Description 
I added a few working routes such as get, which returns products in a JSON format when clicked on, as well as post. Product, category, or tag can be created or a user can search all products, categories, and tags or just search for a specific one by using its ID.

I added the other routes, which are put and delete. A specific product, category, or tag can now be updated or deleted by entering its ID. 

## Installation 
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.

## Usage
Users can search, create, update, or delete various products, categories, and IDs.

## License
None

## Test
Enter node server.js in the command prompt. User should then be able to search, create, update, or delete various products, categories, and IDs.
